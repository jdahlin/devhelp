>	Let's look at PonG usage in a bit more detail.  First off there are
	3 basic file includes.  The first is pong/pong.h this is the basic
	PonG library interface.  Second is pong/pong-glade.h, which is the
	interface to the PonG module, and third the pong-bonobo/pong-bonobo.h
	which will pull in all the headers neccessary for the PonG bonobo
	functionality.  So includes would look like this

	<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><P
><B

>	The first thing a program will do is initialize the library.  This
	is not a memory or time intensive function, so it can safely be done
	at the beginning of the program, but it doesn't matter, you can just
	as well do it before your first use of PonG.  The initializing function
	is called pong_init.  Normally you might want to also enable some
	extra modules (plugs, more about that later) of PonG, such as the
	bonobo and/or glade modules.  In that case you can also run
	pong_bonobo_init and pong_glade_init, that will set up the library
	to understand the bonobo and glade plugs.  In that case make sure
	to use the pong_bonobo and pong_glade arguments to gnome-config, or
	just add glade and bonobo to the PONG_CHECK macro as described below.
	The initialization functions return a boolean which can indicate
	an error in initialization, that is, they return FALSE, if
	initialization of PonG failed.  So you would do something like:

	<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><P
><B
>Example 3. Initializing</B
></P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  if ( ! pong_init () || ! pong_glade_init () || ! pong_bonobo_init ()) {
    g_warning ("Initializing PonG failed!");
    exit (1);
  }
	  </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV
>
      </P
><P
>	After initialization, you will want to let PonG know the directory
	where your PonG files are stored.  This is done with
	pong_add_directory which takes a single string argument with the
	directory.  This will most likely come from your Makefile as a define,
	depending on the prefix that the user chose.  If you are also using
	glade, you should also call pong_add_glade_directory.  This will allow
	you (and the .pong files) to refer to .pong and .glade files by their
	basename only, making things look a lot neater, and more relocatable.
	Assuming that you made a define DATADIR which expands to the prefix
	of the data directory the application uses (say "/usr/share"), this
	could be a possible setup:

	<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><P
><B
>Example 4. Directories</B
></P
><TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  pong_add_directory (DATADIR "/application/pong/");
  pong_add_glade_directory (DATADIR "/application/glade/");
	  </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV

      </P

>	Now next thing you want to do is to load the file and show the dialog.
	This can be simply done with the pong_run_simple_dialog function.  This
	takes a single argument which is the filename of the file to load and
	display.  It returns a GtkWidget pointer of the dialog shown.  It will
	return NULL, if it couldn't load a dialog from that file, so you
	should check for that condition too.
	You probably only want to show the dialog once, so you
	may want to do womething like this:

	<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><P
><B
>Example 5. Running the dialog</B
></P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>void
show_preferences (void)
{
  static GtkWidget *dialog = NULL;

  /* if the dialog exists, just show and raise it */
  if (dialog != NULL) {
    gtk_widget_show_now (dialog);
    gdk_window_raise (dialog-&#62;window);
    return;
  }

  dialog = pong_run_simple_dialog ("mypongfile.pong");
  if (dialog == NULL) {
    g_warning ("Cannot load mypongfile.pong");
  } else {
    /* on destruction of the dialog, make the dialog
     * variable NULL again */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (dialog), "destroy",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_widget_destroyed), &#38;dialog);
  }
}

>	When you are done with using PonG and want the library to give up as
	much memory as possible you can call the pong_free_unused_data
	function, which takes no arguments.  You can call this at any moment,
	what it does is clear any caches, or any other storage that can be
	easily rebuilt.  This means that calling it is transparent, and only
	affect performance of PonG.  A good idea is to bind the "destroy"
	signal of the dialog or the PongXML object (more on that in next
	section) and call this function from there.
