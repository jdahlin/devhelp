>	While the standard widgets are OK for most applications, it is
	sometimes necessary to write a custom widget which may even live only
	inside the application.  To do this, there is an interface API in
	PonG by which you can add the PonG interface to a GTK+ class.  You can
	then use this widget just like any other native PonG widget inside
	your .pong files.  In fact all you have to do to use the widget is to
	link it into your application and PonG will find it automatically
	if the platform supports gmodule.  If you call the _get_type method
	of your widget, it will be initialized and GTK+ object system will
	know about it, and then it will work even without gmodule.
      </P
><P
>	The basics of the implementing a widget using the PonG interface is
	using the pong/pong.h or pong/pong-widget-interface.h includes in your
	implementation (not in the header file neccessairly) and in the class
	initialization function, calling pong_widget_interface_add, which
	takes the class as an argument (cast to "GtkObjectClass *").  This
	will return a structure pointer for you to fill out.  The structure
	is defined as follows:

	<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"

>	The changed_signal is just a character string which refers to a signal
	of your widget that PonG should monitor for changes.  For example
	in a GtkEntry, this is "changed".  The rest of the items are function
	pointers, get_value and set_value must be implemented, the rest can
	be left NULL if you do not implement that functionality.
      </P
><P
>	The get_value and set_value get or set the value of the widget.  If
	a wrong type is passed in, they should return FALSE, on success they
	should return TRUE.  These work with the GConfValue type for which you
	should see the GConf documentation.

>	The get_value and set_value get or set the value of the widget.  If
	a wrong type is passed in, they should return FALSE, on success they
	should return TRUE.  These work with the GConfValue type for which you
	should see the GConf documentation.  PongType is an enumeration that
	is defined in pong/pong-type.h header file.  The four basic value
	which are most used are PONG_TYPE_STRING, PONG_TYPE_INT,
	PONG_TYPE_FLOAT and PONG_TYPE_BOOL.  The types correspond to
	GConfValue types, however unlike in GConf the types are completely
	enumerated and so you get types such as PONG_TYPE_LIST_OF_FLOATS or
	PONG_TYPE_PAIR_STRING_INT.
      </P
><P
>	The add_options function is given a list of structures of type
	PongOption, which has two string fields, "label" and "value".  These
	correspond to the options defined in the .pong file, and for example
	correspond to the choices the user is given in an option menu.
      </P
><P
>	The set_label function is used to set a label of a widget.  Most
	widgets do not implement this functionality and the label is created
	for them by PonG and is placed left of the widget.  But some widgets
	might have a special place where to put the label and they can
	implement it this way.
      </P
><P
>	The set_arg can be safely ignored, if it is unimplemented, PonG
	will use the standard GTK+ argument system such as you would when
	you use gtk_object_set.  Implementing this function will bypass
	the argument setting and is used in the corba interface.  It's not
	considered good style to implement your own arguments this way but
	it would certainly work.  I however recommend gob for making new
	objects and then implementing it with GTK+ arguments is far simpler.
      </P
><P
>	Note that gob style object naming is used by PonG when referring to
	widgets, so ':' is used to separate words.  For example GtkButton
	would be written as "Gtk:Button".  This way PonG can easily construct
	methods for that objects, for example the get_type function which
	would be gtk_button_get_type.
